Running the baseline simulation now.
Done with baseline simulation.

placeholder constraint found: [+plain][][+cg]
constructed a projection for the smallest natural class : 
-sonorant-continuant

placeholder constraint found: [+plain][][-continuant,+sg]
constructed a projection for the smallest natural class : 
-sonorant-continuant

placeholder cosntraint found: [+sonorant,-continuant,+palatal][][-back]
but, no superset classes exist that include both classes to either side of the placeholder
